                    <p>
                        My name is Oluchukwu A. Offor and I prefer 
                    to be called Anderson. I was born in a community
                    called Nsukwa, in Delta State, Nigeria. I am married 
                    with 3 children. I currently work as a sales personnel.
                    I love to code and desperately in need to learn more and collaborate
                    with other students. I spend most of my free time coding or
                    researching programming materials and publications. I am true fan of
                        <span id="learn">"Teach to Learn"</span>
                        learning strategy. It is what I do on daily bases and it has greatly improved my rate
                    of knowledge retention.
